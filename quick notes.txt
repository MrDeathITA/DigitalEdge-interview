   StockQuotesResponse response = stocks.quote(line);
                    StockQuote stock = response.getStockQuote();
                    System.out.printf("Date: %s, price: %s%n", stock.getLatestTradingDay(), stock.getPrice());
              




glaring issues

pretty hardcode-y

the error handling is mostly undefined and unexplained

the workflow of the server is extremely barebones

no oop strategies implemented


glaring issues regarding the task implementations themselves

right now the code only accepts the correct string, it should be so that it can take any input and then if it exists as a stock, it pulls it out and does the little game
the end condition for both is very primitive (aka "end")
socket programming is lousy?




what i had to do

tried to quickly re-learn APIs on java, tried to not use maven, ended up using maven anyway

ended up using a wrapper (this took most of the time away)
